# OCDS for GPA

To promote open, fair and transparent competition in government procurement markets, a number of [World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/) (WTO) members negotiated the [Agreement on Government Procurement](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gp_gpa_e.htm) (GPA).

This website provides guidance on how to publish [OCDS](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) data in a way that is consistent with the rules established in the [text of the Agreement](https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/rev-gpr-94_01_e.htm). You may read the guidance in two ways:

* [Read selected parts of the GPA, with annotations on how to publish the information using OCDS](gpa.md)
* [Read selected parts of the OCDS, with references to the GPA and details on how to publish](ocds.md)

## Governance

OCDS for GPA is a profile of OCDS that combines community and core extensions:

* [ocds_participationFee_extension](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds_participationFee_extension)
* [ocds_additionalContactPoints_extension](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds_additionalContactPoints_extension)

Core extensions are subject to [OCDS' governance process](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/support/governance/). Community extensions may establish their own governance process.

The profile itself – i.e. this website – is non-normative guidance. Please report issues for this profile on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-contracting-extensions/ocds-for-gpa/issues).

## History

OCDS for GPA was developed by the Open Contracting Partnership with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
